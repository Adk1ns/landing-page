              To live in the information age is a gift, we have the power to
              change the world easier than ever. With global communication
              technology at our finger tips we have the power to create and
              expand on every possible idea within human imagination. My mission
              is to turn ideas into reality and produce digital solutions that
              aid human progress. What will you do with this gift?
              {/* In 2018 I was tasked with building a simple Wix page for my sales
              team at an old job, I loved working on the project so much I
              deceided to keep learning more. Realizing my passion was in
              creating rather than sales; I decided to take the leap and become
              a full time web engineer.{' '} */}
